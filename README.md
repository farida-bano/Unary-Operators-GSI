Let's break down the code step by step:

let a: number = 5; - Declares a variable a of type number and initializes it to 5.

let b: number = 2; - Declares a variable b of type number and initializes it to 2.

let c: number; - Declares a variable c of type number without initialization.

c = ++a + a++ + --b + b-- + a + b++ + b; 
- Assigns the result of the expression to variable c. 
Let's evaluate the expression step by step:

++a: Pre-increment a to 6, so a becomes 6, and this expression evaluates to 6.
a++: Post-increment a to 7, but the value of a before incrementing is used in the expression, so this evaluates to 7.
--b: Pre-decrement b to 1, so b becomes 1, and this expression evaluates to 1.
b--: Post-decrement b to 0, but the value of b before decrementing is used in the expression, so this evaluates to 1.
a: a is 7 at this point.
b++: Post-increment b to 1, but the value of b before incrementing is used in the expression, so this evaluates to 1.
b: b is 1 at this point.
So the expression evaluates to 6 + 7 + 1 + 1 + 7 + 1 + 1 = 24.

console.log(c); - Prints the value of c, which is 24, to the console.

Therefore, the output of this code will be:
24
